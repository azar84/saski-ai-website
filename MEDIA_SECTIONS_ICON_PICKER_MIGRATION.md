# Media Sections Icon Picker Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the MediaSectionsManager component to use the enhanced UniversalIconPicker for feature icons, providing users with improved cross-library search functionality.

## Changes Made

  showLabel={false}
  className="w-full"
/>
```
