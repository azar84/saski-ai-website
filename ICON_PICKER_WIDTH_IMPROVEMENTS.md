# Icon Picker Width & Visibility Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the UniversalIconPicker component to be significantly wider and more visible, addressing user feedback about the narrow search menu that was difficult to use.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dropdown Width & Positioning
**File:** `src/components/ui/UniversalIconPicker.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
className="absolute top-full left-0 right-0 mt-1 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-xl z-50"
```

**After:**
```typescript
className="absolute top-full left-0 mt-1 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-xl z-50 min-w-[600px] w-max max-w-[800px]"
```

### 2. Enhanced Grid Layout
**Before:**
```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-8 gap-1 p-2">
```

**After:**
```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-12 gap-2 p-4">
```

### 3. Improved Spacing & Padding
- **Header padding**: Increased from `p-3` to `p-4`
- **Search input padding**: Increased from `py-2` to `py-3`
- **Grid padding**: Increased from `p-2` to `p-4`
- **Icon button padding**: Increased from `p-2` to `p-3`
- **List item padding**: Increased from `px-3 py-2` to `px-4 py-3`

### 4. Larger Icon Sizes
- **Grid icons**: Increased from `w-5 h-5` to `w-6 h-6`
- **List icons**: Increased from `w-5 h-5` to `w-6 h-6`
- **Check icons**: Increased from `w-4 h-4` to `w-5 h-5`

### 5. Enhanced Controls
- **Filter dropdown**: Increased text size from `text-xs` to `text-sm`
- **View mode buttons**: Increased padding from `p-1` to `p-2` and icon size from `w-3 h-3` to `w-4 h-4`
- **Search stats**: Increased text size from `text-xs` to `text-sm`

### 6. Better Visual Indicators
- **Library indicators**: Increased size from `w-2 h-2` to `w-3 h-3` and text from `text-[6px]` to `text-[8px]`
- **Empty state**: Increased icon size from `w-8 h-8` to `w-12 h-12` and improved typography

## Key Improvements

### 1. Width & Visibility
- **Minimum width**: 600px (was constrained by parent)
- **Maximum width**: 800px (prevents excessive width)
- **Responsive**: Uses `w-max` for optimal content-based sizing

### 2. Better Grid Layout
