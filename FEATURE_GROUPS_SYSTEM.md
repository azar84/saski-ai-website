# 🎯 Feature Groups System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Feature Groups system allows you to create reusable collections of features that can be displayed on different pages with custom headings and subheadings. This makes the features section dynamic and allows different pages to show different feature sets.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Reusable Feature Collections**: Create groups of features that can be used across multiple pages
- **Custom Headings**: Each group has its own heading and optional subheading
- **Page Assignments**: Assign different feature groups to different pages
- **Admin Management**: Full CRUD operations through the admin panel
- **Flexible Display**: Frontend automatically adapts to show the appropriate features
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallbacks if no groups are assigned

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Models Added

#### `FeatureGroup`
```prisma
model FeatureGroup {
  id              Int                   @id @default(autoincrement())
  name            String                // Internal name (e.g., "Home Page Features")
  heading         String                // Display heading (e.g., "Why Saski AI?")
  subheading      String?               // Display subheading (optional)
  isActive        Boolean               @default(true)
  createdAt       DateTime              @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime              @updatedAt
  groupItems      FeatureGroupItem[]    // Features in this group
  pageAssignments PageFeatureGroup[]    // Pages using this group
}
```

#### `FeatureGroupItem`
```prisma
model FeatureGroupItem {
  id             Int            @id @default(autoincrement())
  featureGroupId Int
  featureId      Int
  sortOrder      Int            @default(0)
  isVisible      Boolean        @default(true)
  featureGroup   FeatureGroup   @relation(fields: [featureGroupId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  feature        GlobalFeature  @relation(fields: [featureId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

#### `PageFeatureGroup`
```prisma
model PageFeatureGroup {
  id             Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  pageId         Int
  featureGroupId Int
  sortOrder      Int          @default(0)
  isVisible      Boolean      @default(true)
  page           Page         @relation(fields: [pageId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  featureGroup   FeatureGroup @relation(fields: [featureGroupId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Feature Groups (`/api/admin/feature-groups`)
- **GET**: Fetch all feature groups with their features and page assignments
- **POST**: Create a new feature group
- **PUT**: Update an existing feature group

### Feature Group Items (`/api/admin/feature-group-items`)
- **GET**: Fetch feature group items (optionally filtered by group)
- **POST**: Add a feature to a group
- **PUT**: Update feature order/visibility in group

## 🎨 Admin Panel Features

### Feature Groups Manager (`/admin-panel` → Feature Groups)

#### Group Management
- ✅ Create/edit/delete feature groups
- ✅ Set custom heading and subheading for each group
- ✅ Activate/deactivate groups
- ✅ View group statistics (feature count, page assignments)

#### Feature Assignment
- ✅ Expand groups to manage features within them
- ✅ Add existing features to groups
- ✅ Remove features from groups
- ✅ Reorder features within groups (drag & drop UI ready)
- ✅ Toggle feature visibility within groups

#### Visual Interface
- ✅ Modern card-based design with expand/collapse
- ✅ Icon display for all features
- ✅ Real-time success/error messaging
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts
- ✅ Intuitive add/remove controls

### Pages Manager Enhancement
*Note: This would be a future enhancement to allow direct assignment of feature groups to pages from the Pages Manager*

## 🖥️ Frontend Integration

### FeaturesSection Component Enhancement

The `FeaturesSection` component now supports multiple display modes:

#### Props
```typescript
interface FeaturesSectionProps {
  features?: GlobalFeature[];           // Direct feature override
  featureGroupId?: number;              // Specific group ID to display
  pageSlug?: string;                    // Auto-detect group by page
  heading?: string;                     // Override group heading
  subheading?: string;                  // Override group subheading
}
```

#### Priority System
1. **Direct Features**: If `features` prop provided, use those
2. **Specific Group**: If `featureGroupId` provided, fetch that group
3. **Page-Based**: If `pageSlug` provided, find assigned feature group
4. **Fallback**: Load all visible individual features

#### Usage Examples
```jsx
// Use specific feature group
<FeaturesSection featureGroupId={1} />

// Auto-detect by page
<FeaturesSection pageSlug="home" />

// Override heading/subheading
<FeaturesSection 
  pageSlug="about" 
  heading="Custom Heading"
  subheading="Custom subheading"
/>

// Direct feature control (existing behavior)
<FeaturesSection features={customFeatures} />
```

## 📊 Sample Data Created

The system includes three sample feature groups:

### 1. Home Page Features
- **Heading**: "Why Saski AI?"
- **Subheading**: "Simple. Smart. Built for growing businesses"
- **Features**: Multi-Channel Support, AI-Powered Automation, Smart Integrations, Global Language Support, Knowledge Base, Enterprise Security

### 2. About Page Features  
- **Heading**: "Built for the Future"
- **Subheading**: "Enterprise-grade features that scale with your business"
- **Features**: Enterprise Security, Real-time Analytics, Smart Integrations, 24/7 Availability

### 3. Integration Features
- **Heading**: "Connect Everything"
- **Subheading**: "Seamless integrations with your favorite tools"
- **Features**: Multi-Channel Support, Smart Integrations, Knowledge Base

## 🔄 How It Works

### Admin Workflow
1. **Create Features**: Use the Features Manager to create individual features
2. **Create Groups**: Use Feature Groups Manager to create collections
3. **Assign Features**: Add relevant features to each group with custom order
4. **Set Headings**: Configure display heading and subheading for each group
5. **Assign to Pages**: Link feature groups to specific pages (manual or automatic)

### Frontend Display
1. **Page Load**: FeaturesSection component determines which features to show
2. **Group Detection**: Finds assigned feature group or uses fallback
3. **Dynamic Rendering**: Displays features with group's heading/subheading
4. **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Benefits
- **Content Flexibility**: Different pages can showcase different feature sets
- **Brand Consistency**: Standardized feature presentation with custom messaging
- **Easy Management**: Non-technical users can reorganize features without code changes
- **Scalable**: Add unlimited feature groups and page assignments
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper relations and caching

## 🎯 Use Cases

### E-commerce Site
- **Home Page**: "Why Choose Us?" - Core selling points
- **Product Pages**: "Product Features" - Specific product capabilities  
- **About Page**: "Company Strengths" - Business differentiators

### SaaS Platform
