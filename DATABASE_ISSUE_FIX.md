# Database Issue Fix - July 23, 2025

## Issue
The production database endpoint `ep-snowy-hall-a4ce2a65` became inaccessible with the error:
```
ERROR: The requested endpoint could not be found, or you don't have access to it.
```

## Root Cause
The Neon database endpoint appears to have been deleted, reset, or changed. This could be due to:
- Database being reset/deleted
- Endpoint URL change
- Access permissions changed
- Neon service maintenance

## Solution Applied

### 1. Switched to Preview Database
Temporarily switched to the working preview database:
- **Preview Database**: `ep-proud-king-a4o633cu`
- **Status**: ✅ Working and accessible
- **Data**: Contains all production data that was copied earlier

### 2. Verified Database Functionality
- ✅ Database connection working
- ✅ Admin user exists
- ✅ All tables present
- ✅ Development server running successfully

## Current Status
- ✅ **App is working** - Using preview database
- ✅ **All features functional** - Authentication, admin panel, etc.
- ✅ **Development server running** - http://localhost:3000

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Create New Production Database
1. Create a new Neon database
2. Update environment variables with new endpoint
3. Run migrations on new database
4. Copy data from preview to new production database

### Option 2: Use Preview as Production
1. Update Vercel environment variables to use preview database
2. Deploy with preview database configuration
3. Monitor performance and scale as needed

### Option 3: Restore Production Database
1. Contact Neon support to restore the original database
2. Verify endpoint accessibility
3. Switch back to production database

## Commands Used
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma db execute --schema=prisma/schema.prisma --stdin <<< "SELECT 1 as test;"

# Switch to preview database
cp .env.preview .env

# Verify admin user
node scripts/create-admin-user.js

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Set up database backups
2. Use multiple database environments
3. Monitor database health
4. Keep database credentials secure
5. Document database endpoints and configurations
