# Production Database Fix - July 23, 2025

## Issue
The deployed app was failing with the error:
```
The table `public.admin_users` does not exist in the current database.
```

## Root Cause
The production database was missing several tables that were defined in the Prisma schema but not created due to migration conflicts. The main missing tables were:
- `admin_users` - Required for authentication
- `design_system` - Required for the design system
- `pages` - Required for page management

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Missing Tables
Executed SQL scripts to create the missing tables:

```sql
-- Created admin_users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "admin_users" (
    "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "username" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "passwordHash" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT,
    "role" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'admin',
    "isActive" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    "lastLoginAt" TIMESTAMP(3),
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "admin_users_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- Created design_system table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "design_system" (...);

-- Created pages table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "pages" (...);
```

### 2. Added Default Data
Inserted default data to ensure the app works properly:
- Default design system with standard colors and typography
- Default home page
- Default site settings

### 3. Verified Admin User
Confirmed that the admin user already exists in the database.

## Result
- ✅ Authentication system now works in production
- ✅ Design system is available
- ✅ Home page is accessible
- ✅ Admin panel is functional

## Commands Used
```bash
# Created missing tables
npx prisma db execute --schema=prisma/schema.prisma --file=create_admin_users.sql

# Added default data
npx prisma db execute --schema=prisma/schema.prisma --file=create_default_data.sql

# Verified admin user
node scripts/create-admin-user.js
```

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always run migrations in production before deploying new features
2. Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` for production deployments
3. Test database schema changes in staging environment first
4. Keep migration history synchronized between local and production
